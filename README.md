In this second project of GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop a *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app on a topic of your choice using [JHU CSSE Covid-19 Data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) or NYC Health open data released on the [NYC Coronavirus Disease 2019 Data](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data) website. See [Project 2 Description](doc/project2_desc.md) for more details.  

The **learning goals** for this project is:

- business intelligence for data science
- study legacy codes and further development
- data cleaning
- data visualization
- systems development/design life cycle
- shiny app/shiny server

+ **Project summary**:

Ever since the outbreak of COVID-19 last year, millions of people were taken by the disease. The widespread virus not only brought crushing effects to the economy and politics around the world but also even reshaped everybody’s lifestyles. From being anxious in panic, doubts, and worries, to living along with the virus while actively finding ways out, the word COVID-19 remains an influential issue to all humanity in 2020. In face of a pandemic disaster, the transparency of information is undoubtfully important, providing people with an accurate understanding of the situation they are facing.

Our map, like many other online information platforms, aims at presenting general information about COVID-19 to people in need. By using the dataset from NYC open data, we perform the visualization of NYC COVID-19 cases directly on the map column, and the brief analysis of demographic distribution. The time-series graph of the past three months’ development of COVID also provided users with the trend in NYC.
